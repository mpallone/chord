Create the following Profile in gnome-terminal:
Terminal -> Edit -> Profiles...
Click "New"
Profile name: HOLD_OPEN (leave 'Base on:' set as 'Default')
In the "Title and Command" tab: Set the 'When command exits:' to "Hold the terminal open"
Save this profile

make sure 'echo $GOPATH' displays $HOME/go
e.g., /home/rrr/go

Create the following directory structure:
$HOME/go/src/github.com/robcs621/

# Example on my computer, your home directory will differ from mine (rrr) obviously:

# from the robcs621 directory:
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621 ~] git clone https://github.com/robcs621/proj2.git
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621 ~] cd proj2

# make sure scripts are executable 
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2 ~]chmod u+x create_test_nodes.sh
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2 ~]chmod u+x start_test_nodes_and_client.sh
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2 ~]chmod u+x client/run_client.sh

# after running the following script, you should have 4 test_node directories 
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2 ~]./create_test_nodes.sh

# now start 4 test_nodes and the client (the number of nodes can be changed easily at the top of both scripts)
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2 ~]./start_test_nodes_and_client.sh

# to run all of the sample test messages at once, close out only the CLIENT terminal window and then do the following:
# (the client will connect to test_node1, based on the port currently in the client.config, which can be changed)
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2 ~] cd client/
/home/rrr/go/src/github.com/robcs621/proj2/client ~] go run client.go client.config < sample_input/client_test_messages.txt
