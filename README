Follow the Go installation instructions:
https://golang.org/doc/install

Create the following Profile in gnome-terminal:
Terminal -> Edit -> Profiles...
Click "New"
Profile name: HOLD_OPEN (leave 'Base on:' set as 'Default')
In the "Title and Command" tab: Set the 'When command exits:' to "Hold the terminal open"
Save this profile

make sure 'echo $GOPATH' displays $HOME/go
e.g., /home/rrr/go

Create the following directory structure:
$HOME/go/src/github.com/robcs621/

# Example on my computer, your home directory will differ from mine (rrr) obviously:
# These assume your $PATH variable contains $GOPATH/bin

# from the robcs621 directory:
git clone https://github.com/robcs621/proj2.git
cd proj2

# make sure scripts are executable 
chmod u+x *.sh

# build the binaries, which should be available under $GOPATH/bin and $GOPATH/lib
./build.sh

# configure the node instances by providing a conf directory and number of instances
# instances will be numbered starting at 7001, where instances number represents port number
/config_gen.sh <config_dir> <store_dir> <num_instances>

# To spawn instances, use the following script. When run without instance#, all avaialable configs will loaded.
# out_mode must either be "gnome-terminal", "tmux", or "null"
./spawn.sh <out_mode> <config_dir> [instancenum.config instancenum.config...]

# to run all of the sample test messages at once, close out only the CLIENT terminal window and then do the following:
# (the client will connect to test_node 7001, based on the port currently in the client.config, which can be changed)
client client/client.config < sample_input/client_test_messages.txt
